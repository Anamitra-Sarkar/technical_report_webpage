# technical_report_webpage

A simple, static website for hosting and presenting a technical report. This repository contains HTML (and optionally CSS/JS/assets) for a clean, portable webpage that showcases a technical report, supporting files, and any supplementary resources.

## Project overview

This project provides a single-page (or small multi-page) static website intended to present a technical report (text, figures, tables), provide a downloadable PDF, and include metadata for easy sharing and discovery. It is built with plain HTML (and typical static web assets) so it can be hosted with GitHub Pages or any static file host.

Key goals:
- Present the report in a readable, responsive web layout
- Provide an embedded preview and direct PDF download
- Simple to preview locally and deploy to GitHub Pages
- Accessible and SEO-friendly base structure

## Features

- Responsive, mobile-friendly layout
- Embedded report preview (PDF or HTML)
- Download link for the full report PDF
- A section for authors, abstract, and references
- Easy GitHub Pages deployment
- Minimal dependencies — pure static site (HTML/CSS/JS)

## Example live demo
If the repository is published on GitHub Pages (username.github.io/repo), the site will be available at:
https://<your-github-username>.github.io/technical_report_webpage

(Replace <your-github-username> with your GitHub username.)

## Getting started — preview locally

No build tool is required. Use a local static server to preview:

Option A — Python (quick):
1. In the repo root:
   python3 -m http.server 8000
2. Open your browser at http://localhost:8000

Option B — Node (serve):
1. Install `serve` if needed:
   npm install -g serve
2. Run:
   serve -s .

Option C — VS Code:
- Use the "Live Server" extension to preview.

## Suggested repository structure

This is a recommended structure — adjust to match the repo files:
- index.html                      # Landing / report viewer
- report.pdf                      # Downloadable PDF (if available)
- assets/
  - css/
    - styles.css
  - js/
    - app.js
  - images/
    - figure1.png
- README.md
- LICENSE

Note: I couldn't read your repository files due to an API error. If you want the README to list the exact files present, paste the file list here or allow me to re-check the repo and I'll update this section with exact filenames and descriptions.

## How the page typically works

- index.html contains sections:
  - Header with title, authors, date, and a short abstract
  - Main content with embedded PDF preview (via <iframe> or <embed>), or direct HTML content
  - References and supplemental materials links
  - Footer with license and contact info
- A download link or button points to `report.pdf` for offline viewing or printing

Embedding example (index.html):
- Use <iframe src="report.pdf" width="100%" height="700px"></iframe>
- Provide an alternate download link for browsers that block embedded PDFs

## Accessibility & SEO tips

- Use semantic HTML5 elements (header, nav, main, article, footer)
- Provide alt attributes for all images
- Ensure color contrast is sufficient for readability
- Add meta description and Open Graph tags for sharing:
  - <meta name="description" content="Short summary of the technical report...">
  - Open Graph and Twitter cards help previews on social platforms
- Add structured data (JSON-LD) if you want rich metadata for search engines

## Customization

- To change styling, edit assets/css/styles.css
- To change behavior (e.g., PDF viewer logic), edit assets/js/app.js
- To add additional pages (e.g., supplementary.html), link them from index.html or a nav bar

## Deployment (GitHub Pages)

1. Push the repository to GitHub.
2. In the repository settings → Pages:
   - Source: choose the branch (e.g., main) and folder (/root or /docs) where index.html lives.
3. Save. After a few minutes your site will be published at:
   https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/

If you prefer, you can place static build (if any) into a /docs folder and select that as the Pages source.

## Contributing

- Bug reports and feature requests: open an issue describing the problem and include screenshots or steps to reproduce.
- Pull requests: fork, make changes in a feature branch, and open a PR with a clear description of what's changed and why.
- Keep changes small and discuss large structural changes in an issue first.

## Suggested improvements / roadmap

- Add responsive CSS framework (Tailwind, Bootstrap) or custom grid for advanced layouts
- Integrate a JS PDF viewer (PDF.js) for better cross-browser embedding
- Add unit/regression tests for HTML/CSS validation via CI (e.g., html-validator-action)
- Add a simple script to generate HTML summary pages from a report markdown or LaTeX export
- Automate GitHub Pages deployment with actions if you use a build step

## License

Choose a license and add a LICENSE file. Common choices:
- MIT — permissive, simple
- CC BY — if you want a Creative Commons license for the content

Example: add a `LICENSE` file with MIT or CC terms.

## Contact / Maintainer

Maintainer: Your Name or GitHub handle  
Email: optionally your contact email

---

If you'd like, I can:
- Re-run a repo read to enumerate actual files and update the "Repository structure" and "How the page works" sections with file-specific examples.
- Produce an index.html or styles.css adapted to the files you have.
- Create a GitHub Pages-ready commit and open a PR (I can do this if you want me to push changes).

Tell me whether you want me to (A) retry reading the repo now, (B) update the README with exact file names if you paste the file list, or (C) create example index.html/styles.css files and a pull request to add them.
